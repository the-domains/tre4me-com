About TRE

TRE
**(r)** stands for Tension Releasing Exercises. These 
exercises evoke a Self-Induced Unclassified Therapeutic Tremor (SUTT) in
the body which discharges stress or tension accumulated from difficult 
situations, immediate or prolonged stressful situations, and/or 
traumatic life experiences (i.e., natural disasters, social or domestic 
violence) or every day circumstances (i.e., school exams, job stress, 
financial concerns, etc),

TRE
**(r)** is being used by thousands of people around the 
world as an effective tool for releasing everyday stress and anxiety, 
physical/muscular tension, and the reduction of psycho-emotional stress .

**Stress, Anxiety & Tension**

Stress, anxiety and its subsequent tension patterns exist on a 
continuum from mild anxiety to severe trauma. However, prolonged stress 
or anxiety can create muscular tension patterns in our bodies that have 
become so usual we don't even realize they are affecting our posture and
health. This unconscious tension becomes "chronic tension." Eventually,
these chronic tension patterns can create physical aches and pains, 
gastrointestinal problems as well as severe illnesses. Experiences of 
prolonged psychological or emotional abuse, domestic or social violence,
stressful jobs, financial problems or traumatic events can all be 
causes of chronic muscular tension.

**Trauma**

Because traumatic experiences can often be emotionally and 
physiologically overwhelming, the body stores the memories, thoughts and
emotions of the trauma in order to process them at a later date. The 
high chemical charge left in the body after stress, anxiety or trauma 
continually seeks a discharge from this over-stimulation. The brain and 
body work together to try to release this over-excited state so that it 
can return itself back to a calm and relaxed state. Post Traumatic 
Stress (PTS) is the term used to explain the continuation of disturbing 
thoughts, emotions and feelings that persist even after the tension is 
over. Chronic stress, anxiety or PTS is caused by the lack of release of
the high excitement or anxiety that was generated at the time of the 
difficult event(s).

**The Body**

Stressful experiences often cause very deep muscle contractions 
designed to provide protection to the body to help it survive the 
stressful or traumatic event. It is essential to release this chronic 
tension pattern after the stressful event has ended to help prevent the 
development of physical pain and muscular constrictions.

Once the stressful event is over, the body's nervous system is designed
to literally shake out deep muscular tension patterns and help the body
return to its normal relaxed state. However, due to our overemphasis on
the mind, we have deadened this shaking mechanism so that it no longer 
has the opportunity to naturally reduce muscular tension and return our 
bodies to a healthy, relaxed state.

Through TRE(r), we can self-induce this almost effortless, sustained, neuro-muscular vibration or shaking mechanism .

**The Exercises**

TRE**(r)** is a set of easy to follow exercises, activated 
in an intentional and controlled manner, which help release deep 
muscular tension from the body. The exercises help the body to naturally
shake away stress and release and unwind its own muscle tension.

The uniqueness of this technique is that this shaking originates deep 
in the core of the body of the psoas muscles. These gentle tremors 
reverberate upwards along the spine releasing tension from the sacrum 
(pelvis) to the cranium (head).

The exercises are designed to either stretch or mildly stress the 
muscles to activate this reflex response and to sustain it 
comfortably... This simple and easy process gently induces what we call 
"therapeutic tremors".
