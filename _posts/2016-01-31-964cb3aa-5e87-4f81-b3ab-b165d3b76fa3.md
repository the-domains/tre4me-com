About Nan

Born and raised in NYC, I came to the SF Bay Area having not succeeded brilliantly in a quest for a career as an actor/singer/dancer: I only succeeded in becoming a waitress, bartender, and restaurant manager.   ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3e9e8583-3362-42e9-92d9-b13bec139a1a.jpg)

At age 28 I decided to turn a page, change a coast, and see what happened. Though I had contacts in the restaurant business in my new home town, I was ready to leave that alone, too,  opting instead to become an office temporary worker and soon was making more than a decent living being a "kelly girl."  This lead to permanent positions at institutions like the phone company, Bank of America, and finally at several technology startups.  The "music stopped" for me early in our new century \[can you say dot com implosion\] when it became clearer and clearer that I was making way too much money for the work I had been doing and was also far too old to be doing it.  All the postings for positions I'd previously held were being offered to recent graduates who were happy to be paid 30% what I'd been making for similar duties.

I decided if I was going to make "no money" I would be doing something _I _thought was worthwhile.  This is where my career in how to be healthy and happy, began.

When I arrived in the Bay Area in the 1980s, in addition to doing office work, I went to night school.  While others got their MBA, it made more sense to me to study healing and meditation at the Berkeley Psychic Institute.  We can talk about that when you see me.  They had an affiliate group, the Church of Aesclepion, and there I continued spiritual study in healing, hands-on-healing, and finally in supporting women having their babies downstairs at our Marin Birth Center (free-standing) where I had the privilege of graduating from the Church's Spiritual Midwifery Program (doula), and supporting the labor and delivery of scores of babies. 

This is where I first encountered a human being tremoring.  The birthing room was always really warm, and yet 9 moms out of 10 "shivered" after delivery, while nursing baby, or a few stitches were taken:  I couldn't imagine they were cold. \[though it's no time for an interview, and I never asked what was happening\].  There, teaching became a reality for me in my 1st &2nd trimester class: Exercise,  Nutrition, and Meditation for Early Pregnancy. 

So more than ten years ago my career transitioned from being business by-day and performing arts by night, into somatic wellness as a result of a long self-healing journey triggered by a motorcycle accident.  From massage therapy to Restorative Exercise and Pilates, I have been certified in multiple disciplines; TRE(r) being only the latest of my diverse skill set. I maintain a vibrant private practice and instruct community-based classes throughout the Bay Area.

I tell you all this to only to illustrate that I have been in the birthing room, board room, the bar room, and the gym and yoga room facilitating things for people who can do seemingly both seemingly super-human things as well as for those who can barely stand on their own two feet, and just about every one in between.   And it's been my privilege to do so.
